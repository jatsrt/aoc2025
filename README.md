# Advent of Code 2025 - Elixir Solutions

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) implemented in Elixir, with a focus on educational value and thorough documentation.

## 🤖 The Experiment: 100% AI-Generated

**This year's approach was an experiment: use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) to solve 100% of Advent of Code 2025.**

Every line of code in this repository was generated by Claude (Opus 4.5), including:
- The initial project setup and framework
- All 12 day solutions
- All test files
- All documentation and writeups
- Even this README

My role was purely supervisory: reading puzzle descriptions, providing inputs, verifying answers on the AoC website, and occasionally providing guidance when Claude needed clarification. The goal was to explore what's possible when AI handles the entire implementation while a human provides oversight.

### Results

## Goals

- **Explore AI Capabilities**: Test Claude's ability to solve algorithmic challenges
- **Learn Elixir**: Use AoC as an opportunity to explore Elixir's functional patterns
- **Document Everything**: Each solution includes detailed reasoning and explanations
- **Share Knowledge**: Make solutions accessible to others learning Elixir or algorithms

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Run a specific day
mix day 1

# Run with example input (for testing)
mix example 1

# Run tests for a specific day
mix test.day 1

# Run all example tests
mix test

# Run all tests including full puzzle inputs
mix test --include solution
```

```

## Solution Format

Each day includes:

1. **Solution Module** (`lib/aoc2025/days/dayXX.ex`)
   - Implements `part1/1` and `part2/1`
   - Includes parsing logic and helper functions
   - Documented with `@moduledoc` and `@doc`

2. **Tests** (`test/days/dayXX_test.exs`)
   - Verifies example inputs match expected outputs
   - Tests full puzzle inputs (tagged `:solution`)

3. **Writeup** (`solutions/dayXX.md`)
   - Problem summary
   - Solution approach and reasoning
   - Complexity analysis
   - Lessons learned
